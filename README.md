# Trivia Night

A trivia game featuring questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The live version of the game is hosted [here](fahali.github.io/trivia_night). No installs are necessary, just visit the webpage and enjoy the game! (Please excuse the current appearance of the webpage as the project is still a work in progress)

## Technologies Used

This project will be written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. One of the stretch goals (the last one, actually), is to re-write the Javascript using jQuery, just as a personal challenge to help me learn the technology.

The project is hosted via GitHub Pages, served directly from my public repo.

Features and issue tracking / management is handled with Trello. Check out my progress [here](https://trello.com/b/LL1B6SMi/trivia-night-seir-p1).
